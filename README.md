The existing system provided centralised based solution for keeping important documents of people, but it gives overload to the Server, also cause brech in privacy of an indiviual.  The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, time wastage in storage and retrieval of data . These issues are solved by providing a decentralised user account to every indivuals by using Blockchain Technology. Keeping each indiviualâ€™s data separate 
   
   This project uses <b>Arcana Network</b> as backend and is developed in <b>ReactJs</b> for login purpose we are using <b>Unstoppable Domain</b>  and for sharing the documents we are using <b>Polygon ID</b> so it provides features such as Decentrslisation, high performance , security and Digital Identity (Zero Knowledge Protocol).
